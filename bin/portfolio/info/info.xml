Gilles Sabrié is an independent photographer based in Beijing. After years working in television, he switched career to embrace his true passion, documentary photography.

Since then, he particularly focused on documenting social changes in China where the settled three years ago.

This focus is rooted in the evidence that the country’s incredibly fast rise over the past decades is history in the making, but also born out of a permanent questioning: how do human beings cope with such a rapid transformation of the society they live in?  A global issue for which answers can be more easily traced in China, a country where everything happens on a larger scale.
