   <asset id="Landscape" src="land-016_menu.jpg" title="A NEW URBAN LANDSCAPE">One of the founding elements of China’s transformation over the past decades has been the urbanization of its population. The share of rural population dropped from 74% to 46% in just over 25 years. This phenomenon has triggered a total reshaping of China’s urban landscape. Historic neighborhoods have been razed to leave room to high rises and shopping malls. Alleyways have become expressways. Meanwhile this influx of population has put urban infrastructures under stress.</asset>
   
   <asset id="Opera" src="Op-01_menu.jpg" title="THE TRAVELING OPERA">Eight hours a day, seven days a week, Gao, Tianjun and their friends are on stage, impersonating Princes, Generals and Emperors. Keeping alive one of China greatest cultural heritage, its opera.Under scorching heat or freezing cold, they sing, dance and mime stories of love, wars and treason in front of a mesmerized audience of peasants. They go from villages to cities, year around, bringing with them stories of an ancient and long gone China. Their shiny and colorful clothes off, they live the low life, sleeping and eating on the floor, trying to make-do with the meager money earned from their skillful art.</asset>   
   
   <asset id="Olympics" src="Ol-12_menu.jpg" title="WATCHING THE OLYMPICS (OR NOT)">On August 8 2008, were officially opened the Beijing Olympics. Much more than a sport event, these Olympics marked a turning point in China’s history. On that day China showed itself and the international community that it was no longer a developing Nation but one of the most powerful in the world.  
In Beijing nothing was left to chance and the capital lived in heightened security weeks ahead of and during the event. Outside the stadiums, no popular celebration, no spontaneous party was tolerated. Locals were asked to stay at home, and migrants to go back home. The streets were inundated with stars spangled red banners. These Olympics were meant to be a well orchestrated televised event celebrating a newfound National pride. This photo essay is the story of how Beijing watched the Olympics.</asset>      
   
   <asset id="Tibet" src="Tib-01_menu.jpg" title="TIBET OR NOT TIBET?">In the provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, Qinghai and Gansu live 3 million Tibetans. This region stands as major point of disagreement between the Chinese authorirties and the Tibetan government in exile who it to be included as part of Tibet, thus accounting for 25% of Chinese territory. The increasing political and religious repression in the area has heightened the sense of a Tibetan identity.
This photo essay takes us to this vast borderland where Tibetan culture is both thriving and under threat, amid poverty and growing resentment against Beijing policy.</asset> 
   
   <asset id="Kash" src="Kash-08_menu.jpg" title="KASHGAR: A CULTURAL DEMOLITION">Kashgar old city, at the edge of the Talklamakan desert, is the cradle of Uyghur culture. A major step on the Silk Road, the city is a unique maze of small lanes lined by courtyard mud houses where a centuries old lifestyle endures.  This architectural gem is being destroyed in the name of safety and modernity. In the process its 200 000 inhabitants will move to high rises on the outskirt of the city. 
“What would you say if someone would destroy the Eiffel Tower arguing that it could be struck by lightning?” asked me on young inhabitant. The destruction of Kashgar old city has become an additional point of discord between the local Uyghurs and their rulers, the Chinese government. Han immigration to Xinjiang province, along with restrictions on the practice of religion, on the use of Uighur language at school, and now the demolition of the traditional habitat are understood by the locals as a deliberate attempt by the ruling Chinese to erase their culture.</asset> 

   <asset id="Xinj" src="Xin-10_menu.jpg" title="RED HOT XINJIANG">Traveling through Xinjiang, one can’t escape the question, «Is this still China ?». The indigenous Uyghur look Turkic, speak and write a language which shares nothing with Mandarin, and turn more often to Mecca than Beijing. However, as time goes, Xinjiang looks increasingly like any part of China. Han migration is making the Uyghur population a minority, traditional housing is being destroyed and and Xinjiang cities are starting to resemble any other Chinese city. Meanwhile, Han migration and the Central government investment in the province have created an economic boom which has only marginally benefitted the Uyghurs who feel alienated. Resentment between Xinjiang ethnic groups is stirring and has lead to deadly riots in Urumqi in July of 2009. Close to 200 people were left dead, mainly Han migrants lynched by an enraged Uyghur mob. The subsequent crackdown and "strike hard" policy implemented by the government has further fueled anger and resentment.</asset> 

   <asset id="Adoption" src="Ado-06_menu.jpg" title="ADOPTION ISLAND">On the Pearl River in Guangzhou, stands Shamian Dao, a small island, oasis of calm and history in a busy modern city. Among many colonial buildings stands the US Consulate where each year thousands of American couples complete the last piece of administrative paperwork before heading back home with their newly adopted Chinese baby. To them it is the end of a long and often harrowing process and the beginning of a new family life. On Shamian dao they spend their first days with their new child.</asset>

   <asset id="Mingongs" src="Min-09_menu.jpg" title="MINGONGS">Driven to the big cities by the increasing poverty of rural China, peasant-workers or mingongs have become the working force behind the country economic growth. The great majority of them try to make a living as construction workers, but also as peddlers, security guards, housekeepers, waiters or prostitutes.They survive in dire conditions, possibly motivated by the hope of success or more certainly by the memory of even worse conditions back home. There are 200 millions of them in Chinese cities. The biggest migration recorded in human history.</asset>

Most affected by the epidemy are migrant workers, drug users, sex workers, transgenders and gays. The alienation and repression of many among these groups contribute to the spread of the virus.

   <asset id="_175M" src="175M-16_menu.JPG" title="175M">The Three Gorges dam on China's Yangzi river is the world largest hydro power project and has been the dream of the country's leaders for almost a century. Over 1.4 millions have been resettled to give way to the huge reservoir that has submerged the Yangzi valley in 2009. Entire villages have been destroed while new cities have been erected further up. In the cities about to disapper, big "175M" boards told the inhabitants the level soon to be reached by the reservoir and prepared them for a forced relocation. The following story shot from Chongqing to the dam describes the life along the shore of the Yangzi, as the locals, stunned, try to cope with an ever-changing landscape and resettlement.</asset> 

   <asset id="Earthquake" src="Earth-17_menu.jpg" title="AFTER THE EARTH SHOOK ">On May 12 2008, an earthquake of magnitude 8 struck Sichuan and its neighboring provinces. The disaster, one of the worst in the country’s history, took the lives of over 90 000 people, and made close to 10 million people homeless. The earthquake triggered a huge solidarity effort across China. The government and the PLA were praised for their swift response, for quickly allowing foreign rescuers in, as well as for allowing media to freely report on the event. A high proprtion of victims were students, mainly a consequence of poorly constructed schools. As allegations of corruptions surfaced, the government censored media, closed access to foreign journalists, silenced parents and jailed whistleblowers. 
This photo essay was shot during the 6 days that followed the earthquake.</asset>
