The share of rural population dropped from 74% to 46% in just over 25 years. This phenomenon has triggered a total reshaping of China’s urban landscape. Historic neighborhoods have been razed to leave room to high rises and shopping malls. Alleyways have become expressways. Meanwhile this influx of population has put urban infrastructures under stress.</asset>
